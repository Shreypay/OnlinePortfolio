        During my time in Dublin High School, I have gained work experience through CSE. During this time I we worked on
        small projects like building apps through block coding and learned python to an extent where we can solve small
        problems like and inventory storage manager.

    <p>
        I have worked bigger projects outside of school. Over the summer of 2021 I took my first internship in 8th grade
        where I worked with other employee where I got hands on experince in the work force. I worked on 2 main areas
        during my internship. My job was to webscrape our website so that we have the information of our clients. The
        end objective was to convert this list into a CSV file which is my second task. To convert the output into a CSV
        file. Before starting this internship I had very little knowledge about JS which made it difficult for me to
        learn how to complete my task. The first 3 days of my internship I stayed up till 3 am learning the things I
        needed to know to make a web scraper.
    </p>
    <p>
        In the end I was able to get a great experience of the workforce and learn how a start-up company manages. I
        also had to push my self as my fellow interns and the people I worked with where much older and more experienced
        then me.
